We are pleased to announce that our lab (the laboratory of Dr. Rui Chen at UC Irvine) has been selected as the first U.S. installation site for the Pyxa™ platform, a next-generation 3D spatial transcriptomics system developed by Stellaromics. This installation expands Stellaromics’ global beta program, following the inaugural deployment at the University of Glasgow in October 2025.

<b>Advancing 3D Spatial Multi-omics at UCI</b>
The Pyxa platform enables high-resolution, multiplexed 3D spatial transcriptomics in intact tissue sections up to 100 µm thick. By capturing hundreds of molecular targets with subcellular precision, Pyxa preserves native tissue architecture—allowing researchers to map cell–cell interactions, molecular gradients, and complex structural features that cannot be resolved using traditional 2D or dissociated single-cell methods.
Our team will apply Pyxa to generate comprehensive 3D spatial atlases of the human eye and trigeminal ganglion, providing new insights into sensory function and disease mechanisms.

<b>A Milestone for Spatial Biology at UCI</b>
This deployment brings cutting-edge 3D spatial multi-omics to UC Irvine and strengthens our role in driving innovative technologies for vision research, sensory neuroscience, and cell atlas development.
