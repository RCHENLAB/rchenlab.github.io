# Decode our own genome

With over 30 million variants in the human genome, which ones are important? Through the lens of human variation and diseases, we focus on advancing our ability to identify, assess, and predict variants with functional consequences using an interdisciplinary approach. 

Our lab uses innovative genetics and genomics, single cell omics, computational, and imaging tools to understand the connection between genetic variants and human diseases, using the visual system as the model.

### Our own genomes carry the story of evolution, written in DNA, the language of molecular genetics, and the narrative is unmistakable.

By using patient data, mice model, and retinal organoids, our research aims to identify, assess, and predict genetic variations which can lead to Mendelian and complex visual disorders.
