  description: By integrating newly generated and previously published datasets, we developed version 1 of the human RPE and choroid cell atlas. This atlas includes scRNA-seq data from 205,925 cells from 67 donors and snRNA-seq data from 742,625 nuclei from 54 donors. Additionally, we incorporated snRNA-seq data from 136,555 nuclei from developmental RPE/choroid tissues spanning post-conception weeks (PCW) 10-23.
